## EIWG brings together statisticians and clinicians to support the estimand journey

**To provide a cross-industry forum to:**

- share Industry and Academic experiences of implementing the new estimand framework introduced in ICH E9(R1)
- discuss issues emerging through implementation
- be champions and engage in scientific discussion about the value and benefits of the framework

**With the aim to:**

- give feedback and recommendations for best practices
- promote broad understanding and awareness of the framework within and outside of statistics
- consolidate issues and topics for discussion with the ICH E9 Implementation Working Group
- provide training through case studies, e.g., through the EIWG Estimand Training Academy
