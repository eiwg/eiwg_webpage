## Become a member

The general spirit of the working group is inclusive. If you'd like to contribute in one or the other way, we propose you first reach out to your company's representative(s) (if applicable) and align within your company who is best placed to contribute to which sub-team. After that is clarified reach out to the leads - contact details available [here](organization.html).

## Connection to professional organizations

The working group was established by [EFPIA](https://efpia.eu/) and [EFSPI](https://www.efspi.org) as one of three [EFSPI working groups](https://www.efspi.org/EFSPI/About_EFSPI/Working_Groups.aspx).
