## Purpose

EIWG brings together statisticians and clinicians to support the estimand journey

## Activities

Beyond work in the [subteams](subteams.html), the aim of the working group is to provide answers to estimand implementation questions through a variety of activities. These will include: 

 + Collaborating with experts to refine and possibly extend implementation.
 + Publishing reviews, case studies, and white papers with recommendations, for statisticians and non-statisticians.
 + Interacting with clinicians, regulators and the broader clinical community to obtain a better understanding of their requirements. 
 + Providing trainings, workshops and talks.

On this webpage we provide information regarding activities, [trainings](trainings.html) and [publications](publications.html) of the EIWG.

## Connection to professional organizations

The working group was established by [EFPIA](https://efpia.eu/) and [EFSPI](https://www.efspi.org) as one of three [EFSPI working groups](https://www.efspi.org/EFSPI/About_EFSPI/Working_Groups.aspx).
