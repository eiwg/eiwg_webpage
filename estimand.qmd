## What is an estimand?

From the glossary of the [ICH E9: estimands addendum](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E9-R1_Step4_Guideline_2019_1203.pdf):

_A precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the clinical question posed by the trial objective. It summarises at a population-level what the outcomes would be in the same patients under different treatment conditions being compared._

## Where should I start?

The [trainings](trainings.html) page is a starting point. Further, a [3min intro video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeoTOOlx37c): *What is an estimand in a clinical trial: The PIONEER 1 example*.
