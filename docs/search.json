    "text": "Achievements 2022\n\nTraining sub-team\nThe training committee has continued to work on webinars for their training series ‘EIWG Estimand Training Academy’ targeting anyone working in clinical trials.\nAll trainings provided so far are freely available as ‘Video-on-Demand’ PSI Portal or YouTube on the EFPIA channel\n\n\nEstimation sub-team\nEstimating the treatment-policy strategy with continuous data and incomplete post-IE follow-up is a relevant and under-researched issue. To address it, the group has assessed the performance of different estimators – based on either multiple imputation (MI) or mixed effect models (MMRM) – for simulated trials based on the HbA1c endpoint from the PIONEER1 study. The properties of the estimators (bias and variance shown here) generally confirm the equivalence of MI and MMRM approaches (if the same assumptions are made) and the particular importance of collecting post-IE data. The complex trade-off between variance inflation and accuracy needs to be carefully evaluated further.\n\n\nEarly Phase & Other Studies sub-team\nThis sub-team was created as a forum for both statisticians (industry & academia) and pharmacokinetics as well as regulators to help bridge the gap in the estimands framework with regards other study types including early phase and clinical pharmacology where the purpose is not confirmatory efficacy. We presented a poster (Does the Estimand Framework Add Value to Clinical Pharmacology Trials?) at the PSI conference 2022. A manuscript is under preparation with focus on bioequivalence/bioavailability studies and is planned to be published in a clinical pharmacology journal in 2023. The implementation of estimands in early phase studies (including dose finding and CRMs) are also being discussed within this workstream. We aim to share some of our work at the PSI conference in 2023.\n\n\nCommunications sub-team\nIn 2022 the homepage of the group was fully revised and summarizes all work of the EIWG. Posters of the working group were presented at the 2022 PSI conference in Gothenburg and the 2022 Regulatory Industry workshop in Basel.\n\n\nEstimands in non-inferiority trials sub-team\nThe ICH E9(R1) includes limited guidance in relation to non-inferiority (NI) trials. Current regulatory guidelines on NI trials predate the release of the addendum and the per protocol analysis set plays an important part in the EMA NI guidelines. In contrast, ICH E9(R1) questions the role of the per protocol set and this has led to confusion as regards to the applicability of the EMA Points to consider on switching between superiority and non-inferiority. The sub-team is discussing which estimands can be considered relevant in an NI setting and how they fit into existing guidelines. The sub-team members are sharing recent regulatory feedback on NI trials, and we are discussing questions such as - What is the underlying clinical question to be answered in an NI trial? - Are two estimands with different strategies for intercurrent events required to reflect the spirit in the EMA Points to consider on switching between superiority and non-inferiority? - Can protocol violations be handled as intercurrent events? Is there any remaining role for a Per Protocol analysis set? - Can different estimands be used to show NI and superiority in the same trial (hierarchical set-up)? - How does the estimand framework impact the choice of the NI margin?"

In addition, we will engage delegates through considering how estimands might apply to their own clinical settings, interactive quizzes and break out rooms for team discussions of a case study. To get the most from this training, delegates should be prepared to switch on cameras for discussions and complete some tasks between sessions. Team discussions will be supported by EIWG tutors.\nDate & Times\n\nModule 1 - Monday 10th March: 09:30-15:00 BST\nModule 2 - Thursday 20th March: 09:30-15:00 BST\nModule 3 - Friday 21st March: 09:30-15:00 BST\nModule 4 - Friday 28th March: 09:00-15:00 BST"
